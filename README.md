# Coding Challenge Based on Boston Employee Earnings Report

###Description of the Problem and Solution

"Using the Boston Employee Earnings Report, create a simple web API service which given a job title, will respond with the average salary for that position (the average salary should be based on Total Earnings and not Regular)."

####Goal: 
A wee web app that lets a user enter a title, and then returns the average salary for that position based on the data as presented in the Boston Employee Earnings Report, here:
https://data.cityofboston.gov/Finance/Employee-Earnings-Report-2014/4swk-wcg8

####Accomplished:
A basic app structure with an HTML index page with jQuery loaded, and a Javascript page that makes calls to the database when the button in the HTML is pressed.

####Left to Do:
If given additional time, I would debug the calls/JSON parsing so that it got usuable data. Then I would be able to proceed with processing the data to get the average salary, as well as adding the UI function of letting the user enter the title they wanted to send to the database.

###Technical Reasoning
I used a web page with Javascript and jQuery because that is the most familiar to me (and the least bulky thing I am quickly able to do.)

####My personal website, containing my resume and projects, is:
